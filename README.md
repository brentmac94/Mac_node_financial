•	Frameworks are now available for pretty much all development environments. Explain the value of a framework like Sails.js. What are the positive aspects, and what are the negative aspects of a framework?

Pros:
-	Efficiency: There are many pre-built functions that do a lot of the work “behind the scenes”.
-	Security: The more popular the framework, the larger community of users who can advise any vulnerabilities
-	Cost: Most frameworks are free- less opportunity cost coding since there is some much already done behind the scenes.
Cons:
-	You know more about the framework than the actual code
-	Limitations: There may be certain coding languages that the framework cannot handle.
-	Security: Ironic with the pro- but a large community means many people finding flaws behind the public framework.

•	What applications could benefit from using a framework?
Any application that needs to be standardized for a certain organization could benefit from using a standard framework.
If everyone on a development team all use the same framework, the project will be much more efficient as everyone knows the same buzzwords and process for development.
Frameworks are also optimal for PaaS. A company like AppBuilder has an easier time providing support on their services with a familiar framework.

•	Describe an application where a framework may not be appropriate.

Anytime that there needs to be a lot of flexibility and security is a top priority.
This would be ideal for a corporation where data is sensitive and the application has a very specific purpose.

•	Describe 3 things you learned from this assignment.
1.	How Model View Controller works.
    a.	I learned extensively about the view side of web development in my Web Development course, but nothing about the Model or Controller part.
2.	How to pull in API’s
    a.	While simple, it was very neat to me to pull in real time data into my webpage by the help of your course materials. I look forward to doing something similar for our project.
3.	How picky OpenShift is.
    a.	This was on me, but I spent hours trying to figure out why only part of my page was functional. Turns out the controller was throwing everything off with the PHP. This made me visualize the Model aspect of the MVC much better as painful as this part was.

•	How could this assignment be improved?
    -	The video tutorials were great- even with using OSX instead of windows.
    My only complaint is the complex process for setting up openshift. I
    would possibly explore if there is better options out there over OpenShift, but I am sure pushing any webpage from Git is complex.
